Server python programming demo


This is a demo created long time ago, this used for distribution before.

Explaination:

access var is a port 
http server library and socketserver library used as there are 2 modules imported. 
Handler used to take control over all request
port is equal to 8000 which mean this connection is go through with port 8000
whole code structure is using those two library mechanics
